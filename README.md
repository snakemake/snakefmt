This repository provides formatting for [Snakemake][snakemake] files. It follows the
design and specifications of [Black][black].

> **⚠️WARNING⚠️**: As this project is still in the very early stages of development, and
> thus not stable, we strongly recommend ensuring your files are under version control
> before doing any formatting. Alternatively, you can pipe the file in from stdin, which
> will print it to the screen, or use the `--diff` option. See [Usage](#usage) for more
> details.

## Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/snakemake/snakefmt
python3 -m pip install poetry
cd snakefmt && poetry install
poetry shell
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Format a single Snakefile.

```shell
snakefmt Snakefile
```

Format all Snakefiles within a directory.

```shell
snakefmt workflows/
```

Format a file but write the output to stdout.

```shell
snakefmt - < Snakefile
```

### Full Usage

```
$ snakefmt --help
Usage: snakefmt [OPTIONS] [SRC]...

  The uncompromising Snakemake code formatter.

  SRC specifies directories and files to format. Directories will be
  searched for file names that conform to the include/exclude patterns
  provided.

Options:
  -l, --line-length INT  Lines longer than INT will be wrapped.  [default: 88]
  --check                Don't write the files back, just return the status.
                         Return code 0 means nothing would change. Return code
                         1 means some files would be reformatted. Return code
                         123 means there was an error.

  -d, --diff             Don't write the files back, just output a diff for
                         each file to stdout.

  --compact-diff         Same as --diff but only shows lines that would change
                         plus a few lines of context.

  --include PATTERN      A regular expression that matches files and
                         directories that should be included on recursive
                         searches.  An empty value means all files are
                         included regardless of the name.  Use forward slashes
                         for directories on all platforms (Windows, too).
                         Exclusions are calculated first, inclusions later.
                         [default: (\.smk$|^Snakefile)]

  --exclude PATTERN      A regular expression that matches files and
                         directories that should be excluded on recursive
                         searches.  An empty value means no paths are
                         excluded. Use forward slashes for directories on all
                         platforms (Windows, too). Exclusions are calculated
                         first, inclusions later.  [default: (\.snakemake|\.eg
                         gs|\.git|\.hg|\.mypy_cache|\.nox|\.tox|\.venv|\.svn|_
                         build|buck-out|build|dist)]

  -c, --config PATH      Read configuration from PATH. By default, will try to
                         read from `./pyproject.toml`

  -h, --help             Show this message and exit.
  -V, --version          Show the version and exit.
  -v, --verbose          Turns on debug-level logging.

```

#### Check

##### `--check`

Does not write any formatted code back to file. It will instead check whether any
changes *would* be made. It returns one of three possible exit codes:

**0** - indicates **no changes** would be made

```
$ echo 'include: "foo.txt"' | snakefmt --check -                                        
[INFO] 1 file(s) would be left unchanged 🎉
$ echo "Exit code: $?"
Exit code: 0
```

**1** - indicates **changes** would be made

```
$ echo 'include:"foo.txt"' | snakefmt --check - 
[INFO] 1 file(s) would be changed 😬
$ echo "Exit code: $?"
Exit code: 1
```

**123** - indicates there was an **error** such as invalid syntax

```
$ echo 'include:' | snakefmt --check -            
[ERROR] L2: In include definition.
[INFO] 1 file(s) contains errors 🤕
$ echo "Exit code: $?"
Exit code: 123
```

#### Compact diff

##### `--compact-diff`

Does not write any formatted code back to file. It will instead print a compact diff of
how the code looks before and after formatting. The diff is compact as it only prints
the lines that will change, with a few lines of surrounding context.

```
$ echo 'x = 1\ny = 3\n\n\nrule foo:\n\tinput: "foo.txt"' | snakefmt --compact-diff -
=====> Diff for stdin <=====

--- original
+++ new
@@ -3,4 +3,5 @@
 
 
 rule foo:
-       input: "foo.txt"
+    input:
+        "foo.txt",

[INFO] All done 🎉
```

The above example shows that the variable assignments at the beginning of the file are
not included in the compact diff (but would be included in a full diff).

#### Diff

##### `--diff`

Does not write any formatted code back to file. It will instead print a diff of how the
code looks before and after formatting.

```
$ echo 'rule foo:\n\tinput: "foo.txt"' | snakefmt --diff -
=====> Diff for stdin <=====

  rule foo:
-       input: "foo.txt"
+     input:
+         "foo.txt",

[INFO] All done 🎉
```

If multiple files are specified, a diff for each file is written to stdout, separated by
`=====> Diff for <filepath> <=====`.

## Design

### Syntax

`snakefmt`'s parser will spot syntax errors in your snakefiles:

* Unrecognised keywords
* Duplicate keywords
* Invalid parameters
* Invalid python code

But `snakefmt` not complaining does not guarantee your file is entirely error-free.

### Formatting

Python code is `black`ed.

Snakemake-specific syntax is formatted following the same principles: see [PEP8][PEP8].

Example File
------------

Input

```python
SAMPLES = ["s1", "s2"]
CONDITIONS = ["a", "b"]

if True:
	rule can_be_inside_python_code:
		input: "parameters", "get_indented"
		threads: 4 # Numeric params stay unindented
		params: key_val = "PEP8_formatted"
		run:

					print("weirdly_spaced_string_gets_respaced")

rule gets_separated_by_two_newlines:
	input:
		files=expand("long/string/to/data/files/gets_broken_by_black/{sample}.{condition}",sample=SAMPLES, condition=CONDITIONS)
```


Output

```python
SAMPLES=["s1","s2"]
CONDITIONS=["a","b"]

if True:
	rule can_be_inside_python_code:
		input:
			"parameters",
			"get_indented",
		threads: 4 # Numeric params stay unindented
		params:
			key_val="PEP8_formatted",
		run:
			print("weirdly_spaced_string_gets_respaced")


rule gets_separated_by_two_newlines:
	input:
		files=expand(
		"long/string/to/data/files/gets_broken_by_black/{sample}.{condition}",
		sample=SAMPLES,
		condition=CONDITIONS,
		),
```
