## [Unreleased]

This release will potentially produce different output to previous versions. Previously,
when passing code to `black` for formatting, we were not allowing for the indentation
level of the code. For example, if a line has an indentation level of two and the code
is 40 character long, the line is 48 characters long. However, we were only passing the
40 characters of code to `black` meaning, in the running example, if you had set
`--line-length 45` the line would not have been formatted. This behaviour is now fixed.

### Changed

- When passing code to `black`, reduce the line length by the indentation level.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- f-strings with triple quotes are now correctly handled [[#55][55]]

## [0.1.0]

### Added
